For classification tasks, there are several pretrained models available such as,
1. ResNet
2. VGG
3. EfficientNet
4. Inception
5. MobileNet
6. Xception
7. DenseNet

They all have different use cases depending on the requirements of the project.

If the project requires a model that can run on edge devices or mobile friendly, MobileNet is best suited as it has low computational complexity

If there is no limitation on computational complexity, Inception can be used which uses a sparse convolutional network.

ResNet and EfficientNet are widely used for object classification as they are moderate in complexity and trainable parameters and offers relatively good accuracy

Xception is combines the features from Inception and ResNet to create a model for object classification.

These are the most popular object classification pretrained models that are being utilised.
